automated testing:
generate png file, and check they are the same.

hook plan:
hook vertexbuffer. it will be used by executing shader, so we also have to hook that as well.

problem:
the opengl api is very imperative (e.g. bindStuff), which make overloading very hard

solution:
wrap it around a layer which call all the bindStuff at once. this way if we forget one it will be an error.

there is ResourceCacheTest, which I should read.

the codebase is extensible by backend, but not further.
look like the codebase use lots of static_cast, so it seems hopeless to touch one of them, and wish to leave other part alone.

on the bright side, look like we can create a 'zombie backend' that is generic over backend.
but for now, lets only create a zombie opengl backend. i am not confident that their code is good enough to support this with little pain.
